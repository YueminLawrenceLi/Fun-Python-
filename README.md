# Fun-Python-Projects 
The goal of this repository is to lay out popular techniques and workflows that a business analytics and data science team may employ to do the following: 

	Statistical & Descriptive Analysis:
-	Numpy & Scipy: Fundamental Scientific Computing
-	Pandas – Data Manipulation and Analysis
-	Matplotlib – Plotting and Visualization
-	StatsModels – Statistical Modeling, Testing, and Analysis
-	Seaborn – Statistical Data Visualization

	Machine Learning Models & Algorithms 
-	Linear Regression 
-	Logistic Regression 
-	Principal Component Analysis 
-	Deep Neural Network 
-	Decision Trees and Random Forests
     
This repository includes the multiple Jupyter notebooks and project (Iris Species, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, Pima Indians Diabetes, Auto MPG, Hand Sign) that demonstrate utilization of common statistical and machine learning libraries for beginner and intermediate python programmers. Hope we can learn and improve together.
